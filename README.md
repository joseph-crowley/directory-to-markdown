A robust, configurable Python tool designed to transform your project directory into a clearly structured Markdown documentâ€”perfectly optimized for documentation, code reviews, and integration with language models.

The converter traverses directories, gracefully handles large files, logs processing details, and manages errors to ensure consistent, reliable outputs.

## Why Use This?

- **Effortless Documentation:** Automatically generate Markdown from source code, enhancing readability and clarity. Share a complete codebase with an LLM.
- **Flexible and Selective:** Include or exclude files by extension, set file-size limits, and skip unwanted directories such as `node_modules`, `.git`, and `__pycache__`.
- **Reliable:** Built-in error handling ensures uninterrupted processing, with clear logging at every step.

## Quick Start Examples

### Convert `.py` and `.txt` files:

```bash
python directory_to_markdown.py my_directory -o docs.md -t .py .txt
```

### Non-recursive directory scan:

```bash
python directory_to_markdown.py my_project -o project_docs.md --no-recursive
```

### Full conversion with defaults (all files):

```bash
python directory_to_markdown.py path/to/directory
```

## Command-line Options

| Option                      | Description                                    | Default       |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `directory` *(required)*    | Directory containing target files.             | -             |
| `-o, --output`              | Output Markdown filename.                      | `output.md`   |
| `-t, --types`               | List file extensions to include (e.g., `.py`). | All files     |
| `-m, --max-size`            | Max file size (MB) to include.                 | `10` MB       |
| `--ignore`                  | Directories to exclude from scanning.          | Common dirs (`node_modules`, `.git`, etc.) |
| `-nr, --no-recursive`       | Disable recursive traversal.                   | Recursive enabled |

## Markdown Output Format

Each file is clearly encapsulated for easy parsing and readability:

>     ## relative/path/to/example.py
>     
>     ```py
>     def example():
>         pass
>     ```


This format ensures readability and easy parsing, suitable for automated ingestion by tools, including large language models (LLMs).

## Intended Use in LLM Contexts:

The structured output (`your_project.md`) facilitates direct ingestion into LLM contexts, providing high-quality, structured input for summarization, code explanation, translation, or AI-driven documentation tasks. Its clarity and consistency optimize comprehension and facilitate automated reasoning about codebases and repositories.
